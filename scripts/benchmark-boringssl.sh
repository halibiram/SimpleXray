echo "📊 BoringSSL Performance Benchmark"
echo "=================================="

# This is a placeholder script for future benchmarking
# Actual benchmarking requires:
# 1. Xray-core binary with BoringSSL integration
# 2. Test harness for encryption/decryption operations
# 3. Performance measurement tools
