# Patch: Enhance XTLS Vision flow with BoringSSL
# This patch optimizes XTLS Vision flow using BoringSSL zero-copy features
#
# Note: This is a template patch. Actual implementation requires:
# - Understanding Xray-core's XTLS implementation
# - Enabling zero-copy with BoringSSL
# - Optimizing splice() syscalls
#
# Expected changes:
# - Modify: proxy/vless/outbound/*.go (if XTLS is in outbound)
# - Enable zero-copy with BoringSSL
# - Optimize splice() syscalls for better performance
#
# This patch should be customized based on actual Xray-core codebase structure
