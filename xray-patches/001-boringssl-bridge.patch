# Patch: BoringSSL CGO bridge placeholder
# This patch is optional - if it fails to apply, build continues with vanilla Xray-core
# BoringSSL is linked via CGO_LDFLAGS in the build workflow
# Full CGO bridge implementation requires Xray-core code modifications

# Note: This patch file exists to document the intent
# Actual BoringSSL integration happens via CGO linking flags in build workflow
# No code changes needed - BoringSSL libraries are statically linked

# This is a minimal placeholder patch that will fail to apply
# but that's OK - BoringSSL linking happens via build flags
